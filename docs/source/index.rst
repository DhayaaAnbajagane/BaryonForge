**The Baryonification pipeline** is a tool for adding baryon-induced corrections to the density field 
and/or adding thermodynamic fields such as the gas pressure, temperature etc. The entire modelling pipeline is built out 
of the Core Cosmology Library (CCL) and can work directly on full-sky maps (or also on particle snapshots if needed).
