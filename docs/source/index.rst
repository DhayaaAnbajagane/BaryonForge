The Baryonification pipeline
===================================


**Baryonification** A pipeline for *Baryonifying* N-body simulations, by adding baryon-induced corrections to the density field 
and/or adding thermodynamic fields such as the gas pressure, temperature etc. The entire modelling pipeline is built out 
of the Core Cosmology Library (CCL).
