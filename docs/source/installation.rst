Installation
============

There is currently no support for PyPi or conda, so you (unfortunately) need to install from source.
To install the package, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/BaryonForge.git

or alternatively you can download the repo yourself and set it up,

.. code-block:: bash
    
    git clone https://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/BaryonForge.git
    cd BaryonForge
    pip install -e .

This will keep the source files in the location you git clone'd from.

To simplify things, the root directory contains a `environment.yml <https://github.com/DhayaaAnbajagane/BaryonForge/blob/main/environment.yaml>`_ file that can be used to construct an environment.
